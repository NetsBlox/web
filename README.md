# Deployment

The deployed version is available here: https://netsblox.github.io/web/. This updates automatically on every push to the `master` branch.

# Development

To view a local instance of the web app, you must build and host the static artifacts.
This must be performed after each code change.

```sh
npm run build && python serve-local.py
```
