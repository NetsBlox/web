      NetsBlox Privacy Policy
    </h1>
    <div class="italic text-gray-600 mb-8">Effective: 9/17/2025</div>

    <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-5 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
      At NetsBlox, developed at Vanderbilt University, we are committed to
      protecting the privacy of all users, especially students. We collect as
      little personal information as possible and never use it for marketing or
      share it with third parties.
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-8 mb-4">
      1. Information We Collect
    </h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 ml-4">
      <li>
        <strong class="text-gray-800">No account needed:</strong> Anyone can use
        NetsBlox without creating an account or providing personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-gray-800">Optional accounts:</strong> To save
        projects to the cloud, users must create an account. This requires only
        an email address which is used in case of a forgotten password. For
        students under 13, we strongly encourage schools to use a teacher's or
        guardian's email address. The teacher dashboard makes it easy for the
        teacher to set up student accounts with the teacher's email address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-gray-800">Automatic technical data:</strong> Like
        most websites, we collect limited technical information (e.g., IP
        addresses, browser type) for server security and performance. This
        information is not linked to individual identities.
      </li>
    </ul>

      2. How We Use This Information

    <p class="mb-3">We only use the email address:</p>
    <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4 mb-4">
      <li>Create and manage user accounts.</li>
      <li>Send password resets or account-related notices.</li>
      <li>Notify about account suspension, if necessary.</li>
      <li>Maintain the security and functionality of the system.</li>

        We follow industry-standard practices to protect stored data (e.g.,
        encryption, secure servers).

      <li>
        While no system is 100% immune to breaches, we take reasonable steps to
        minimize risks.

    </h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 ml-4">
      <li>
        <strong class="text-gray-800">Children's Privacy:</strong> Although
        NetsBlox is exempt from the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
        (COPPA), we voluntarily follow its guidelines.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-gray-800">FERPA:</strong> NetsBlox does not collect
        student educational records and therefore does not create FERPA
        concerns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-gray-800">Other Laws:</strong> Our practices are

            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Do students need an account to use NetsBlox?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">No. NetsBlox can be used without creating an account. Students can build projects and save them locally on their computers without sharing any personal information. An account is needed for saving projects in the cloud or for sharing those projects via web address (sharing can also be done by sharing the file with the locally-saved version of a project).</p>

The teacher dashboard makes it easy for the teacher to set up student accounts with the teacher's email address.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">NetsBlox is operated by Vanderbilt University, a non-profit educational institution.
